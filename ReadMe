I hope, you have successfully install Gurobi Software in Ubuntu

//Sypher004
I have attached the c program file "sypher.c". Just run it and dump the output at "sypher.lp" file.
Here is the commands

	gcc sypher.c
	./a.out>sypher.lp

You can create .lp file (MILP code) for any number of ROUNDS written in C program for sypher004.


//start gurobi


gurobi.sh

Then open new terminal and run the .lp file you have created.

//To Run .lp file (here we can only see the final output only).
 gurobi_cl file.lp
 
 //To get all solution from .lp file
 gurobi_cl ResultFile=sypher.sol sypher.lp
 
 Feel free ask me any questions...!!
